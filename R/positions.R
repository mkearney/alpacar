#' Positions
#'
#' The positions API provides information about an accountâ€™s current open
#' positions. The response will include information such as cost basis, shares
#' traded, and market value, which will be updated live as price information is
#' updated. Once a position is closed, it will no longer be queryable through
#' this API.
